## PIC16F54 Chaser

Just a fun little 12 LED chaser project for PIC16F54. Similar in concept to the PIC16F84A project of which many videos are on YouTube, but the code is written from scratch. The PIC16F54 is very close to the original PIC1650 from 1976 in terms of features (or lack thereof) and instruction set.  I wanted to experience programming one of the first MCUs in assembly so I made this.  Currently uses about 1/4 of the available program memory on the chip.

The project was assembled in MPLAB X v5.45 and the chip was programmed using a PicKit 4.

I also started a KiCad PCB design but it is not finished yet.
